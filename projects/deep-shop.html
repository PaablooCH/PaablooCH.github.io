                                <p>Deep Shop is a <strong>personal development project</strong> created entirely in <strong>C#</strong> and built using <strong>Unity</strong> as the <strong>game engine</strong>. 
                                    Throughout this project, I focus on developing <strong>new systems</strong> and <strong>features</strong> while strengthening my <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>programming skills</strong>.</p>
                                
                                <!-- <p>This project started as a shop manager game. Initially, I developed a basic inventory system to manage products (later renamed to items), money, and karma. 
                                    I also created a sales system where products can be sold to customers, earning money and, based on the product type, either gaining good or bad karma. 
                                    This experience led me to develop my next system: the ability to buy products from a character. This system functions similarly to the previous one, but this time 
                                    the player must choose which products they want to buy, along with their quantities and prices.</p>

                                <p>In addition to the buying system, I wanted to implement a delivery system where, after a certain amount of time, the character could pick up the purchased items. 
                                    To accomplish this, I developed a modular UI that displays recently acquired items.</p>

                                <p>To provide an alternative method for obtaining valuable items, I created a crafting feature with recipes that store the necessary components and, depending on the recipe,
                                     the cost to craft the final product.</p>

                                <p>However, I encountered an issue when attempting to display useful information to the player, such as the recipe for each craft. To address this problem, I developed a modular tooltip system. 
                                    Showing extra information with a header and body. For more complex information,the system also allows customizable information encapsulated in gameObjects. 
                                    The system is activated when the cursor hovers over a component that has a tooltip script.</p>

                                <p>My next task was to develop a dialogue system. To begin, I created an InteractableNPC class. This class serves as the primary component for any system requiring 
                                    interaction between the player and an NPC, such as the dialogue system (utilizing the NPCTalk class) or future quest systems.</p>

                                <p>To store dialogues within conversations, I implemented a Scriptable Object and attached it to the NPCTalk class. When the player interacts with an NPC, these dialogues are sent to the DialogueUI class, 
                                    which ensures that each dialogue is displayed at the appropriate time, along with different portraits of the NPC.</p>

                                <p>My most recent implementation it was the quest system. This system can be splitted in three parts: the quest perse, the segments of each quest and the differents events that are launched in the system. The quests are Scriptable
                                     that manage</p> -->

                                <p>This project began as a <strong>shop manager game</strong>. Initially, I developed an <strong>inventory system</strong> to manage items, money, and karma. Additionally, I created a <strong>sales system</strong> where 
                                    products can be sold to customers, earning money, and based on the product type, either gaining good or bad karma. This experience led me to develop my next system: 
                                    the ability to <strong>buy products</strong> from a character. This system functions similarly to the previous one, but this time the player must choose which products they want to buy, 
                                    along with their quantities and prices.</p>

                                <p>However, at some point, I shifted away from the shop and began creating new features and systems. For example, I implemented a <strong>dialogue system</strong> to interact with NPCs, 
                                    a <strong>crafting system</strong> to provide an alternative method for obtaining valuable items, and my latest implementation, the <strong>quest system</strong> to provide tasks to the player in exchange 
                                    for a reward. Additionally, I incorporated a <strong>tooltip</strong> feature to provide more information to the player.</p>

                                <p>Now, I'm considering my next steps while also continuously updating my past work with the new techniques and knowledge gained from my latest endeavors.</p>
